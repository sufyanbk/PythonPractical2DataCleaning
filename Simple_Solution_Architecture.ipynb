    "**Goal:** Make DSE predictable, fair, and transparent without late‑night babysitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scope:** This notebook explains the *Decision Layer* (Submit Gateway → Pre‑Flight (LITE) → Policy Engine) and demonstrates two fairness strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Target solution:** Fairness & anti‑monopoly controls (executor ceilings, DRF fairness, per‑user concurrency caps, polite preemption, reservation windows & deadlines).\n",
    "2) **Static fairness fallback:** Two resource pools (L/H) with fixed reservations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Use this as an explainer for stakeholders and a starter spec for engineers.*"
